                            transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here.I signed up for
                            the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter the next 12
                            weeks was the best-and most grueling-time of my life.Since completing the course,I've
                            successfully switched careers,working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup".

                    "Before joining the bootcamp,I've
                    never written a line of code .I needed
                    some structure from professionals
                    who can help me learn programming
                    step by step . I was encouraged to 
                    enroll by a former student of theirs
                    who can only say wonderful things
                    about the program. The entire 
                    curriculum and staff did not 
                    disappoint .They were very hands-on
                    and I never had to wait long for
                    assistance .The agile team project,
                    in particular , was outstanding .It took
                    my learning to the next level in a way
                    that no tutorial could ever have . In 
                    fact , I've often referred to it during 
                    interveiws as an example of my development
                    experience.It certainely helped me land a job
